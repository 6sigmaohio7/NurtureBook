# NurtureBook Feature Philosophy & Experience Specification

This document explains the purpose, emotional design, behavior, and long-term strategy behind NurtureBook’s three core pillars:
1. Journals
2. Daily Reflections
3. Wisdom Tree

The goal is to align both development and product direction with the emotional mission of the app.

## 1. Journals

### Purpose
Journals are the core long-form memory-keeping and emotional processing feature of NurtureBook. They give parents a safe, private place to document thoughts, parenting moments, personal growth, lessons, stories, and experiences.

This feature is designed to:
- Build long-term value through accumulated memories  
- Help parents process emotions and reflect more intentionally  
- Preserve meaningful child-development and parenting moments  

### Types of Journals
Users can create and maintain multiple journals, choosing from:

1. **Free Write Journal**
   - No structure, no restrictions, open writing experience
   - Ideal for emotional dumping, storytelling, memory logging, or deep thoughts

2. **Guided Prompt Journal**
   - Provides helpful questions, emotional exploration prompts, or reflection themes
   - Designed for parents who need help expressing or organizing thoughts
   - Prompts may rotate, randomize, or be curated when starting an entry

3. **Daily Question Journal**
   - A simple, consistent question that remains the same for every entry
   - Helps track patterns and growth over time through repetition

### Journal Entry Experience Requirements
- Fully offline and private storage
- Autosave to avoid data loss
- Calm, distraction-free writing UI
- Past entries must be browsable, filterable, and editable
- Editable journal titles and deletion ability
- Mood tagging

## 2. Daily Reflections

### Purpose
Daily reflections are designed to be a lightweight emotional check-in that:
- Builds a daily habit without pressure
- Encourages mindful awareness in short form
- Helps parents track emotional tone over time
- Focuses on consistent micro-growth, not long writing

This is intentionally **short-form**, **low friction**, and **repeatable**.

### Format Requirements
- Maximum of ~5 sentences (not enforced strictly, but UX guides it)
- One reflection per calendar day
- Past reflections must be viewable and organized by date
- Encouraging tone, not performance-driven

### Recommended UX
- Clear and simple daily question or micro-prompt
- No complex formatting — plain text only
- Calming UI, quick to open and complete
- Gentle reminders (optional, not nagging)

### Example Reflection Outcomes
Over time, reflections could help parents see:
- Emotional trends
- Stress triggers
- Wins and gratitude moments
- Personal improvement
- Mood emoji/tone slider
- Auto-generated timeline graph
- Optional syncing with journal themes

## 3. Wisdom Tree (Social-Emotional Feature)

### Purpose
The Wisdom Tree is a future feature designed to become the **community knowledge-sharing pillar** of NurtureBook — but **not a typical scrolling social feed**.  
It should feel **hopeful, supportive, inspiring, and meaningful**, not performative.

The idea:
Users can anonymously or semi-privately share a short piece of parenting wisdom, advice, or reflection that helped them — allowing others to learn, grow, and feel less alone.

The Wisdom Tree should:
- Foster safe, empathetic community support
- Encourage meaningful knowledge, not comparison
- Focus on value, not social metrics like likes or follower counts

### Expected Post Format
- Short, journal-like insight or quote (1–6 sentences)
- Optional tags like: emotions, age group, challenge type
- No usernames or profiles required for reading
- Sharing could be optional, at user's choice, not automatic

### Experience Design
Visually displayed like growing leaves, blossoms, or notes on a tree
Each wisdom entry appears as a leaf, with simple reveal animations

Possible display styles:
- Floating tiles/cards
- Tree branches that populate gradually
- Seasonal themes

### Moderation Rules
- No judgemental content
- No medical advice
